** Numerically Accurate Hyperbolic Embeddings Using Tiling-Based Models

This fork contains two more tiling-based models of the hyperbolic space: 
the 17 dimensional model based on the polytope found by Vinberg and the 6 dimensional model based on the polytope found by Bugaenko. 

The Bugenko's polytope is compact and it is the highest-dimensional compact hyperbolic Coxeter polytope known. 
The Vinberg's polytope is not compact but has finite volume and is the highest-dimensional finite volume hyperbolic Coxeter polytope known. 


** Example: Embedding WordNet Mammals

This shell scripts =train-mammals-vinberg17.sh= and =train-verbs-bugaenko6.sh= include the appropriate parameter settings for training on mammals and verbs datasets using the new tiling-based models.
