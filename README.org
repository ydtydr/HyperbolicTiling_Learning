** Numerically Accurate Hyperbolic Embeddings Using Tiling-Based Models

Forked from ydtydr/HyperbolicTiling_Learning

This fork contains three more tiling-based models of the hyperbolic space: 
the 3 and 17 dimensionals model based on the polytopes found by Vinberg and the 6 dimensional model based on the polytope found by Bugaenko. 

The Bugenko's polytope are compact.
The 17 and 3 dimensional Vinberg's polytope are not compact but have finite volume.


** Example: Embedding WordNet Mammals

This shell scripts =train-mammals-vinberg17.sh=, =train-verbs-bugaenko6.sh=, =train-cora.sh= include the appropriate parameter settings for training on mammals, verbs and cora datasets using the new tiling-based models.
